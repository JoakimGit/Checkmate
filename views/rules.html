            <h2>Rules of chess</h2>
            <p>Chess is a two-player board game where each player has 16 pieces total. Two rooks, two knights, 2 bishops, a king, a queen and 8 pawns. Each piece moves in its own way.</p>
            <p>The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, but games often end in another way. </p>
            <p>A player who knows their position is lost will often choose to resign. There are also several ways for a game to end in a draw.</p>
            <p>The player with the white pieces has the first move. Players then alternate moves. You can't skip a move and the game continues until an end has been reached.</p>
            <h2>Starting position</h2>

            <p>The king moves 1 square in any direction. He can also castle once during the game, moving two squares towards a rook.</p>
            <p>The rook moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically. It also moves to the other side of the king when castling.</p>
            <p>The bishop moves any number of squares diagonally.</p>
            <p>The queen moves any number of squares, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</p>
            <p>The knight moves in an L shape. Two squares horizontally and 1 square vertically, or vice-versa. It can't be blocked.</p>
            <p>The pawn moves 1 square forward, or two from its original position. It can also capture 1 square diagonally. Upon reaching the other end of the board, it promotes into another piece.</p>
            <p>A king is in check when it is under attack by one or more enemy pieces. It is not possible to make a move that would place one's own king in check.</p>
            <p>The game is automatically a draw if the player to move is not in check and has no legal move. This is called stalemate.</p>
